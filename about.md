## About this blog

As **Feynman Technique** told us, to learn one thing thoroughly, one needs to be able to teach others; and Sir Francis Bacon taught us: Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man and writing an exact man.

This is a blog sharing knowledge mostly about cryptography and penetration testing, hopefully by sharing the things I learned, I can be better at them, "by writing"!

## About Kaixiang

I am currently a Master of Information Technology student currently studying in the University of Melbourne. 

During my last year of undergraduate, the cybersecurity caught my attention. It's such a huge topic, and a stimulating one as well. Finding vulnerability is like a real life puzzle with risk but also rewards. I want to join it, and solve it, so I have to improve myself.

Now, on my way of self improvement, I wish to share with you and learn more.
