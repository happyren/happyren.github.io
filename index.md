Security is not an afterthought. It's getting more reality out of the words these days. Data leaks from big corps one incident after another, personal device tracking scandals keep emerging. The cybersecurity is now getting more public exposure than ever before.

Shall we read through those inscrutable privacy policies? Should I stick out the camera on my laptop? Security is complicated, and it's systematic, and you better believe we are not as knowledgable as some of the most skilled foes. 

As a soon-to-be cybersecurity master graduate, despite lack of experience, I'd like to interpret the hot topics, so that we can all learn from the past, prepare for the worst, aim for the best.
