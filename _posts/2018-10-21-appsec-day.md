The just finished OWASP AppSec Day Melbourne is a wonderful experience in the Oct, and probably the most informative day on security of this year for me. I will concisely write down some important information and share with you!

## Something new to me

Some simple and informative ideas I will talk about may not be new to you, but these links definitely helps!

### Important information sources

Here I list some information sources about the vulnerabilities that I learned from this conference:

[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/)

[Common Weakness Enumeration](https://cwe.mitre.org/)

[Common Platform Enumeration](https://cpe.mitre.org/about/)

[Common Vulnerabilities Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/)

### Security SDLC

The core idea is that Security should be integrated into the whole SDLC.

Beyond Agiles and Formal methods, the most important model to be applied is [Essential Eight Maturity Model](https://acsc.gov.au/publications/protect/essential-eight-maturity-model.htm)

### Threat Modelling

Several steps to follow as in an Agile way of modelling threats:

1. User Story -> Abuser Story -> Threat Model -> Security Test Case -> Mitigations.
2. Threat Scenarios -> Security Test Cases Automation -> Invoke Strategic Automations.
3. Constructing a playbook or [using a bot](https://www.we45.com/zap-robot-library-downloadabl) for testing automation.
4. Link threat to model, analyse test coverage.
